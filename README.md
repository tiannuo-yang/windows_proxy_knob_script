# Windows Proxy Knob Script

Are you sometimes annoyed by the occasional malfunction of Windows proxy? Sometimes the proxy app (such as clash) doesn't work, making normal websites inaccessible. This repository provides the following one-click bat scripts: 
- If you just don't want the proxy, turn off the system proxy knob (`close_proxy.bat`)
- Try to re-awaken your proxy app process (such as clash), so restart it (`restart_clash.bat`)
